# Unionized

## Overview

Unionized is a portal for my home infrastructure. The name is dervied from two things. One, I'm a strong proponent of unions, the rights of workers, and the power of the working people against the damn proletariat. Two, my condo complex is named "Union Square" and such my pseudo-company is "Union Squar**ed**". You can probably guess how the name arrives. 

I wanted to have a single portal in which I could control all my IoT devices and servers as well as view network logs. The Ubiquiti UniFi Secure Gateway is shit at viewing network logs. That really was the genesis of this idea, but then my IoT infrastructure grew. So I decided on this project.

It serves as a purpose for me to get more familiar with Angular and SPA development.
